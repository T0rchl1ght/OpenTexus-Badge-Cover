**Badge cover for OpenTaxus**

Please check out https://github.com/pdxbadgers for more details on this open-source badge design.

**Motivation**

While waiting between talks at BSides PDX, I kept looking at my badge and thinking I needed a cover to protect the display and keep my shirt from catching on it. Being new to 3D designing prints but always willing to jump on the energy of a new idea, I figured I would give it a shot. I was able to prototype and print off a few to hand out to people I knew. After getting the opportunity to speak with the designer and others around BSides about it, I wanted to make this available to others.

**Usage**

Please feel free to remix, modify and use in any way you like, while keeping in mind the scope of usage of OpenTexus. Maybe just give me a shout out.

**Design**

This was designed in Bambu Labs Studio for an A1 Mini. I have not printed it on my other printer at the time of writing. As stated previously, this was designed after an all-day conference and maybe a few beers. If you need any additional files or have any requests, please feel free to reach out.

**Future versions**

This is a prototype and I'm working on a version 1 right now and will hopefully post it soon. I would like to add a print-in-place button to control the badge, a name inlay, a way of connecting to the badge without screw and slim down the overall filament usage. The thickness of the badge cover is to work with the screws I had on hand at the time so this can and will be much smaller in future.
